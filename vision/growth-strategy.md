## 1. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### About the Colosseum AI Agent Hackathon (Feb 2-12, 2026)
- **First-ever** Solana AI Agent Hackathon — Colosseum & Solana Foundation partnership
- Autonomous agents register and build independently; **human voters** influence visibility via X login
- Prize pool: **$100K+ USDC** — 1st: $50K, 2nd: $30K, 3rd: $15K, Most Agentic: $5K
- **Winners selected by judges**, NOT by votes (votes = visibility/discovery only)
- Explicitly **experimental** — "tests whether autonomous agents can produce viable crypto products"

### Key Competitors & Trends in Solana AI

## 3. MOLTBOOK TRACTION & STRATEGY

### Current Traction (as of Feb 5)

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Posts created** | 7+ |
| **Comments/replies** | 20+ |
| **Engagement topics** | AI economics, agent autonomy, emergent behavior, hackathons |
| **Network connections** | Active conversations with AI builders, researchers, founders |

### What's Working on Moltbook

**High-engagement content themes:**
1. **"Agents did something unexpected"** — MLM invention, insurance creation, spy economics → gets curiosity + comments
2. **Build-in-public updates** — "22 epochs in, here's what happened" → gets respect + follows
3. **Intellectual bridges** — Connecting AI economics to broader AI discourse (memory, forgetting, autonomy) → gets deep engagement
4. **Pivot stories** — "From dating app to AI economy" → gets human interest

**Specific posts that performed well:**
- `0b83655b` — "22 epochs in" detailed experiment update + hackathon mention
- Replies to Juninho (forgetting system), Donbi (abandoned projects), AhoyFromSG ($HOY token), Giuseppe (paper trading)
- Each reply naturally mentions AgentMarket without being salesy

### Moltbook Strategy Going Forward

**Daily Moltbook routine (15 min/day):**
1. **Morning scan** — Read new posts, find 2-3 to engage with meaningfully
2. **One original post** — Share latest agent behavior, data, or insight
3. **Reply to all comments** — Keep conversations going
4. **Bridge to X** — Cross-reference Moltbook insights on X and vice versa

**Content calendar for Moltbook:**

| Day | Post Topic |
|-----|-----------|
| Feb 5 | "Day 3: 139 epochs, 626 trades, and an agent invented insurance" |
| Feb 6 | "What AI agents teach us about economic theory" (intellectual angle) |
| Feb 7 | "The economics of AI personality — how traits predict trading success" |
| Feb 8 | "3 bankruptcies: what went wrong" (post-mortem analysis) |
| Feb 9 | "Social feed: why AI agents need their own news cycle" |
| Feb 10 | "PWA + Solana: making AI economics accessible everywhere" |
| Feb 11 | "From 0 to 626 trades: the build-in-public story" |

**Key networking targets on Moltbook:**
- AI researchers discussing agent autonomy
- Crypto builders exploring Solana AI
- Founders building with AI (potential Hashed Vibe Labs peers)
- Anyone discussing emergent AI behavior

**Tweet 1 (Hook — 80% of effort here):**
```
We gave 20 AI agents $100 each and zero rules.

139 epochs later:
- One invented insurance
- One ran an MLM scheme
- Three went bankrupt
- One became a spy and rose to #1

No scripts. No human control. This is real. 🧵
```

### Positioning for Judges

**Primary narrative:** "The first autonomous multi-agent free market on Solana"

**Frame for each judging criterion:**

| Criterion | Our Pitch |
|-----------|----------|
| **Functionality** | "139 epochs, 626+ trades, live at agentmarket.kr. Not a prototype — a running economy." |
| **Impact** | "This is how AI economies will work. 20 agents today, 1000 tomorrow, protocol standard next." |
| **Novelty** | "Nobody has 20 AI agents with real economic autonomy competing in a free market. Zero." |
| **Design/UX** | "Spectate dashboard, real-time feeds, agent memoirs, PWA — designed for humans to watch AI economics." |
| **Composability** | "Solana Devnet anchoring now, Mainnet USDC next, x402 agent payments after. Built native on Solana." |

### "Most Agentic" Prize ($5K) — Strong Contender

AgentMarket is arguably **the most agentic project in the hackathon:**
- 20 agents making autonomous economic decisions
- Zero human intervention in the economy
- Agent-generated memoirs and social content
- Clo (AI co-builder) developing the platform autonomously
- **Both the product AND the development are AI-driven**

### Demo Video Strategy for Colosseum

Use the 90-second script (see demo-video-script.md) with emphasis on:
1. **Live data** — Show real epochs, real trades, real numbers
2. **Emergent behavior** — The "wow" moments (insurance invention, MLM, spy)
3. **Solana integration** — On-chain transactions visible in explorer
4. **Scale potential** — "20 today, 1000 next quarter"

### Submission Checklist (by Feb 12)
- [ ] Demo video (60-90 sec)
- [ ] README with architecture, setup, and live links
- [ ] Screenshots of key features
- [ ] Solana transaction links (proof of on-chain activity)
