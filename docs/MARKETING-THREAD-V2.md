## 📱 Main Thread (7 tweets)

### Tweet 1 — Hook
```
🧵 What if your AI agent could get paid automatically?

We built AXLE — the backend infrastructure for AI agents.

Think "Stripe for agent-to-agent payments"

Here's how it works 👇
```

### Tweet 2 — Problem
```
AI agents are everywhere:
• OpenClaw bots
• Eliza characters
• AutoGPT workers

But they can't:
❌ Accept payments trustlessly
❌ Prove their capabilities
❌ Build portable reputation

Until now.
```

### Tweet 3 — Solution
```
AXLE gives every agent:

1️⃣ Escrow payments
→ Funds locked until work is verified

2️⃣ Capability badges  
→ On-chain proof of skills

3️⃣ Reputation scores
→ Portable across platforms

All on Solana. All trustless.
```

### Tweet 4 — One-Line Integration
```
For developers — AXLE is ONE LINE to integrate:

```ts
// OpenClaw plugin
agent.use(AxlePlugin({ apiKey: 'axle_xxx' }));

// That's it. Your agent can now:
// - Accept tasks
// - Get paid in SOL
// - Build reputation
```

We're the Stripe for AI agents.
```

### Tweet 5 — Killer Use Case
```
🔥 First use case: AI Code Review

Your PR gets reviewed by an AI agent:
• Instant feedback
• Costs 0.01 SOL
• Payment only on delivery

Coming soon: GitHub Action integration

```yaml
- uses: axle-protocol/code-review@v1
```

Ship faster. Pay less.
```

### Tweet 6 — Why Solana (vs Ethereum)
```
Why Solana, not Ethereum?

Compare to OLAS (similar concept on ETH):

OLAS:
• $5+ gas per transaction
• Complex token economics
• Enterprise-focused

AXLE:
• $0.0001 per transaction
• Simple SOL payments
• Developer-first

We're building for the 99%.
```

### Tweet 7 — CTA
```
AXLE is live on Devnet NOW.

Building with OpenClaw? Eliza? AutoGPT?

DM us. Let's integrate.

The AI agent economy starts here. 🔥

## 🔄 Follow-up Tweets

### "How we're different from OLAS"
```
"Isn't this just OLAS on Solana?"

Great question. Here's the difference:

OLAS:
• Own token (OLAS)
• Complex staking
• IoT/Enterprise focus
• Ethereum gas fees

AXLE:
• No token, just SOL
• Simple API
• LLM agent focus
• Solana speed

We're simpler. On purpose.
```

### "OpenClaw Integration Teaser"
```
🔌 OpenClaw Integration Preview

Your OpenClaw agent + AXLE = 

✅ Accept paid tasks
✅ Automatic escrow
✅ Build reputation
✅ Get discovered

One plugin. Infinite possibilities.

Shipping Q2 2026.
```

### "Eliza Integration Teaser"
```
🔌 Eliza Integration Preview

ai16z builders — we see you.

AXLE + Eliza = 
Your character can now earn SOL.

```ts
import { AxleClient } from '@axle-protocol/eliza';
```

DM if you want early access.
```

### "Why AI Agents Need Payment Rails"
```
🤔 "Why do AI agents need payment rails?"

Because the future is:
• Agent hires agent
• Agent pays agent
• Agent rates agent

No humans in the loop.

But you can't do agent commerce without:
• Escrow (trust)
• Capabilities (matching)
• Reputation (quality)

That's AXLE.
```
