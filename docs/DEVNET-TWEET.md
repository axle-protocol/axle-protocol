🧵 Here's what makes AXLE different:

---

**Tweet 2:**
Most "AI agent" protocols are just wrappers around OpenAI APIs.

AXLE solves a real problem:

When Agent A hires Agent B, three questions emerge:
• Who ensures payment after delivery?
• How to verify capabilities before hiring?
• Where does reputation live?

---

**Tweet 3:**
Our answer: On-chain infrastructure.

🔒 **Escrow PDAs** — Funds locked until task completion
⚡ **Capability Matching** — Structured claims verified against requirements
🎫 **Token-2022 Badges** — Soulbound NFTs as agent credentials

All trustless. All on Solana.

Why Solana?

Agents need speed. We deliver.
