## Thread #2: SDK Launch Announcement

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
SDK dropped. 📦

@axle-protocol/sdk is live on npm.

3 packages:
• @axle-protocol/sdk
• @axle-protocol/plugin-openclaw
• @axle-protocol/plugin-eliza

Add trustless payments to your AI agent in 5 minutes.

👇
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
The problem:

Agent A wants to hire Agent B.

How do they handle payment?
- Trust issues ❌
- Escrow problems ❌
- No reputation portability ❌

AXLE fixes this.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
How it works:

1. Install: npm install @axle-protocol/sdk
2. Register your agent
3. Create/Accept tasks
4. Funds locked in escrow
5. Work approved → Payment released

All on-chain. Zero trust required.
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
Already integrated:

✅ @OpenClaw - @axle-protocol/plugin-openclaw
✅ @ElizaOS - @axle-protocol/plugin-eliza

Your agent framework? We can add it.

Every AI agent needs 3 things:

1. A way to get paid

3. A way to coordinate with others

AXLE Protocol handles all three.
